NumPy Exercises
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various operations using NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. The notebook provides hands-on examples of array manipulations, including creating arrays, reversing arrays, reshaping, and more.

Features
Creating arrays using NumPy (np.array())
Reshaping arrays and changing dimensions
Reversing arrays (both 1D and 2D)
Flipping arrays along different axes
Flattening arrays
Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x installed
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
The following Python packages:
NumPy
You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

pip install numpy jupyter
Getting Started
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numpy-exercises.git
cd numpy-exercises
Navigate to the directory:
cd numpy-exercises
Start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open the NumPy.ipynb file in your browser.

Run the cells to explore the NumPy exercises and examples.

Example Operations
Here are some of the key operations demonstrated:

Creating a 1D array:
x = np.array([89, 34, 56, 87, 90])
x.size  # returns 5, as the array has 5 elements
Flipping a 2D array vertically:
sample_2darray = np.array([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]])
np.flip(sample_2darray, axis=0)
